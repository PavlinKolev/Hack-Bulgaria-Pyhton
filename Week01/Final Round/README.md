Final Round
========================
In a file, called finalround.py, code the solutions to the following problems:

The solutions should be written in Python 3.

# 1.Is Number Balanced?
----------------
A number is called balanced, if we take the middle of it and the sums of the left and right parts are equal.

For example, the number `1238033` is balanced, because it's left part is `123` and right part is `033`.

We have : `1 + 2 + 3 = 0 + 3 + 3 = 6`.

A number with only one digit is always balanced!

Implement a function `is_number_balanced(n)` that checks if `n` is balanced.

## Test Examples
```python
>>> is_number_balanced(9)
True
>>> is_number_balanced(4518)
True
>>> is_number_balanced(28471)
False
>>> is_number_balanced(1238033)
True
```

# 2.Increasing and Decreasing Sequences
----------------

Implement the following function:

## 2.1 Increasing sequnce?

Implement a function, called `increasing_or_decreasing(seq)` where `seq` is a `list` of integers.

The function should return `Up!`, if the given sequence is monotonously increasing.
If monotonously decreasing return `Down!` .
If both of the condintions are not satisfied, then return `False`.

And before you skip this problem, because of the math terminology, let me explain:

**A sequence is monotonously increasing if for every two elements `a` and `b`, that are next to each other (`a` is before `b`), we have `a` < `b`.**

For example, `[1,2,3,4,5]` is monotonously increasing, but `[1,2,3,4,5,1]` is not.

 Test Examples
```python
>>> increasing_or_decreasing([1,2,3,4,5])
Up!
>>> increasing_or_decreasing([5,6,-10])
False
>>> increasing_or_decreasing([1,1,1,1])
False
>>> increasing_or_decreasing([9,8,7,6])
Down!
```

# 3. Largest Palindrome
----------------

Implement a function get_largest_palindrome(n), which return the largest palindrome smaller than `n`. Given number `n` can also be palindrome.

## Test Examples
```python
>>> get_largest_palindrome(99)
88
>>> get_largest_palindrome(252)
242
>>> get_largest_palindrome(994687)
994499
>>> get_largest_palindrome(754649)
754457
```

# 4. Sum all numbers in a given string

You are given a string, where there can be numbers. Return the sum of all numbers in that string (not digits, numbers)

Examples:

```
sum_of_numbers("1111") = 1111
sum_of_numbers("1abc33xyz22") = 1 + 33 + 22 = 56
sum_of_numbers("abcd") = 0
```
## Signature
```python
def sum_of_numbers(st):
    pass
```

### Test Examples
```python
>>> sum_of_numbers("ab125cd3")
128
>>> sum_of_numbers("ab12")
12
>>> sum_of_numbers("ab")
0
```

# 5. Birthday Ranges
----------------

Implement a function `birthday_ranges(birthdays, ranges)`
We have a list `birthdays` and list of tuples `ranges`. `birthdays` - range from 0 to 365, `ranges` - ranges (one range is a tuple of two numbers - `start` and `end`0.

We want to calculate, for each tuple, how many people are born in that range (between `start` and `end` inclusive).

For example:

```python
Birthdays - [5, 10, 6, 7, 3, 4, 5, 11, 21, 300, 15]
Ranges - [(4, 9), (6, 7), (200, 225), (300, 365)]
```

Will give the result:
```python
[5, 2, 0, 1]
```

As we can see, betweeh 4 and 9, inclusive, there are 5 people with birthdays - 5, 6, 7, 4, 5.Between 300 and 365 there is exatly one birthday - 300.



## Test Examples
```python
>>> birthday_ranges([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (4, 6)])
[2, 3, 4, 5, 2]
```

# 6. 100 SMS

Before the smartphones, when you had to write some message, the keypads looked like that:

![Nokia 3310 Keypad](nokia.jpg)

For example, on such keypad, if you want to write **Ruby**, you had to press the following sequence of numbers:

```
7778822999
```

Each key contains some letters from the alphabet. And by pressing that key, you rotate the letters until you get to your desired one.

It's time to implement some encode / decode functions for the old keypads!

## `numbers_to_message(pressed_sequence)`

First, implement the function that takes a list of integers - the sequence of numbers that have been pressed. The function should return the corresponding string of the message.

There are a few special rules:

* If you press `1`, the next letter is going to be capitalized
* If you press `0`, this will insert a single white-space
* If you press a number and wait for a few seconds, the special breaking number `-1` enters the sequence. This is the way to write different letters from only one keypad!

Few examples:

```
numbers_to_message([2, -1, 2, 2, -1, 2, 2, 2]) = "abc"
numbers_to_message([2, 2, 2, 2]) = "a"
numbers_to_message([1, 4, 4, 4, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 6, 0, 3, 3, 0, 1, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 2, 6, 6, 3, 2])
=
"Ivo e Panda"
```

## `message_to_numbers(messsage)`

This function takes a string - the `message` and returns the **minimal** keystrokes that you need to write that `message`

Few examples:

```
message_to_numbers("abc") = [2, -1, 2, 2, -1, 2, 2, 2]
message_to_numbers("a") = [2]
message_to_numbers("Ivo e Panda")
=
[1, 4, 4, 4, 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 6, 0, 3, 3, 0, 1, 7, 2, 6, 6, 3, 2]
message_to_numbers("aabbcc") = [2, -1, 2, -1, 2, 2, -1, 2, 2, -1, 2, 2, 2, -1, 2, 2, 2]
```
