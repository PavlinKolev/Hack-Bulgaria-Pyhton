# HackBulgaria Airlines

Discover the world with HackBulgaria Airlines!

We need to collect the needed information, in order HackBulgaria Airlines to start working with customers. All data is for one airport!

So lets start with the basic stuff:


## Flight

Make a `Flight` class which can be initialized by that (all constructor arguments are shown in the example below).

```python
f = Flight(start_time=Date(29, 11, 2016, hour='12:20'), end_time=Date(29, 11, 2016, hour='15:30'), passengers=100, max_passengers=120, from_dest="Sofia", to_dest="London", terminal=Terminal(2, 30), declined=False)
```

Hint: Create class `Date` with date and hour information!

## Terminal

We also need class `Terminal`. Our airport can have more than 1 terminal. Initialize it with:

```python
t = Terminal(number=1, max_flights=20)
```

## Passenger

Our Flights cannot fly without passengers!

```python
p = Passenger(first_name="Rositsa", last_name="Zlateva", flight=Flight(....), age=22)
```

## Reservation

Our customers cannot fly without reservation!

```python
r = Reservation(flight=Flight(..), passenger=Passenger(..), accepted=True)
```

## Now comes the funny part!

HackBulgaria Airlines need a lot of information to work with its customers!

Your task is to implement not only the basic classes, but a lot of methods, which the Airline needs. It's time for Test-Driven-Development. First tests, then the main implementation!

You are free to add other methods and attributes!

### Flights for date

Implement a method, which returns the flights for a date:

```python
def get_flights_for(date):
    pass
```

### Flight before 'hour'

Implement a method, which returns the flights before 'hour':

```python
def get_flight_before(date, hour):
    pass
```

### Flight from destination

Implement a method, which returns the flights from a destination:

```python
def get_flight_from(destination):
    pass
```

### Flight to destination

Implement a method, which returns the flights to a destination:

```python
def get_flight_to(destination):
    pass
```

### Flight to/from destination at date and hour

Implement a method, which returns the flights from a destination at date and hour:

```python
def get_flight_to(destination, date, hour):
    pass

def get_flight_from(destination, date, hour):
    pass
```

### All flights from terminal

Implement a method, which returns the flights from a terminal:

```python
def get_terminal_flights():
    pass
```

### Flights from terminal on date

Implement a method, which returns the flights from a terminal:

```python
def get_terminal_flights_on(date):
    pass
```

### Flight duration

Implement a method, which returns the flight duration.

```python
def flight_duration():
    pass
```

### All flights to destination from terminal

Method, which returns all flights for a destination from a terminal

```python
def terminal_flights_to_dest(destination):
    pass
```

### All flights with duration less than 'hours' on a 'date'

```python
def flights_on_date_lt_hours(date, hours):
    pass
```

### All flights within duration

```python
def flights_within_duration(start_time, end_time):
    pass
```

### Passengers under 18 for flight

```python
def passengers_under_18(flight):
    pass
```

### Passengers to destination

Method, which returns all passengers from all flights to destination

```python
def passengers_to_dest(destination):
    pass
```

### Passengers from terminal

Method, which returns all passengers flying from terminal

```python
def passengers_from_terminal(terminal):
    pass
```

### Flights with passengers more than 'number'

Implement a method, which returns the flights with passengers greater than a number

```python
def flights_with_passengers(size):
    pass
```

### Passengers reservations for a flight

Implement a method, which returns the reservations of all passengers for flight

```python
def passengers_reservations(flight):
    pass
```

### Reservations to destination

Implement a method, which returns the reservations to destination

```python
def reservations_to_destination(destination):
    pass
```

### Flight has empty seats

Implement a method, which returns if there are empty seats in a flight.

```python
def flight_empty_seats():
    pass
```

#### Think what will happen if a flight is declined??? What will happen with the passengers?
